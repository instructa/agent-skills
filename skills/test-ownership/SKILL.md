# Test Ownership

## Purpose

Prevent test drift by placing each invariant where the owning layer can prove it with the least duplicated coverage.

## Use when

- adding tests after a bug fix
- moving weak regression tests into canonical suites
- choosing between unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage
- removing duplicate tests that assert the same invariant

## Do not use when

- the user only wants to run existing tests
- the test is pure snapshot churn with no invariant
- the feature lacks a defined behavior to prove

## Inputs needed

- repo state and active branch
- user request and acceptance criteria
- relevant files, diffs, docs, ADRs, or manifests
- known constraints, non-goals, and risk boundaries
- optional capability context when justified

## Output contract

This skill must produce:

```txt
invariant
owning layer
target suite/file
placement action
duplicates to merge/delete
verification run
proof/receipt
ledger event when durable state changes
```

## Workflow

### Phase 0 - Triage

- Restate the task in one sentence.
- Decide whether this skill is the right owner or whether another gate should run first.
- Identify the current artifact, behavior, or decision that can drift.
- Name the expected durable output before touching files.

### Phase 1 - Context gathering

- Read only the files, docs, manifests, tests, or diffs needed for this decision.
- Prefer repo-local architecture and test conventions over generic advice.
- Use optional capabilities only when the request depends on current external facts, ledger state, remote state, scanning, or shell linting.
- Capture missing context as an explicit assumption rather than filling gaps with guesses.

### Phase 2 - Analysis

- Analyze invariant.
- Analyze canonical suite.
- Analyze failure mode.
- Analyze duplicate coverage.
- Analyze determinism.
- Analyze verification command.
- Separate facts found in files from judgments or recommendations.
- Choose one canonical owner or one canonical artifact whenever the decision concerns ownership.

### Phase 3 - Action / artifact

- Produce the smallest durable artifact that satisfies the output contract.
- Keep edits or recommendations scoped to the stated owner and acceptance criteria.
- If writing files, avoid broad rewrites that are not required by the proof target.
- If recording state, prefer provider-backed ledger events and use the fallback ledger when no provider is installed.

### Phase 4 - Verification

- Run the narrowest relevant verification first.
- Add broader checks only when the touched surface or risk requires them.
- Verify generated artifacts are linked from the final report.
- If verification is impossible, state why and what would prove the result.

### Phase 5 - Final report

- Report the decision, changed artifacts, proof, ledger event, risks, and next step.
- Include enough evidence for a later agent to resume without re-reading the whole chat.

## Gates / stop conditions

- Stop if required files or user intent are unavailable.
- Stop if the output would invent authority the repo does not have.
- Stop if a human product/security/architecture decision is required.
- Stop if proof cannot be produced or explicitly marked as missing.
- Stop before remote, destructive, or credential-touching actions without consent.

## Verification requirements

- List files inspected.
- List commands run and exact result.
- List generated or changed artifacts.
- Record manual verification when automation is not available.
- Record unresolved risks instead of implying certainty.

## PlanDB / ledger events

Possible event types:

```txt
proof.receipt.added
ownership.changed
task.updated
```

Fallback path if `plan.ledger` is unavailable:

```txt
docs/plan-ledger/events.jsonl
docs/adrs/*.md
docs/specs/*.md
```

## Optional capabilities

```txt
plan.ledger
```

Only use capabilities that are available, relevant, and justified by the current task.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not hide uncertainty behind confident prose.
- Do not add compatibility layers for internal draft shapes.
- Do not create duplicate owners for the same rule.
- Do not treat chat memory as durable project state.
- Do not use optional capabilities just because they exist.
- Do not add the same invariant at multiple layers without naming distinct failure modes.
- Do not create standalone regression files because they are easier.
